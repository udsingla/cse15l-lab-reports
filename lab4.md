# Lab Report 4 - Doing it All From the Command Line

In this report we edit a file from the command line.
I will be writing the keystrokes I pressed to achieve the goal.

## Step 1: Log In to ieng6:
### keystrokes:
* ssh cs15lsp23de@ieng6.ucsd.edu `<enter>` \
 (I did not need password as I set up the SSH key for ieng6)

## Step 2: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
### keystrokes:
* git clone `<ctrl> + v`(v is added in codeblock as ctrl and v are pressed together)  `<enter>` \
(I copy and pasted https://github.com/udsingla/lab7.git from github)
* cd l `<tab> <enter>` \
this autofills to lab7 and shifted me into the lab7 directory which just got cloned.

## Step 3: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
### keystrokes:
* `<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter> javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` 
* `<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter> java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests` \
(They were 11 spaces above in the terminal from my practice run before) \
It compiled the java files and ran the tests.

## Step 4: Edit the code file to fix the failing test
### keystrokes:
* vim L `<tab>`.j `<tab> <enter>` (autofills to 'vim ListExamples.java' and opens ListExamples.java in vim)
* /change `<enter><down><right><right>` (Searches for word change and then we navigate to the desired place)
* r2 (replaces 1 with 2)
* :wq (saves file and quits vim)

(Ignore the java tests in the above screenshot, they will be relevent in the next step.)

(view when we open the file using vim and after changing index 1 to 2 which is highlighted by cursor)

## Step 5: Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
### keystrokes:
* `<up> <up> <up> <enter>(javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java)` 
* `<up> <up> <up> <enter>(java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests)` \
It was 3 places up in the terminal \
It compiled the java files and ran the tests.

## Step 6: Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account
### keystrokes:
* git add ListExamples.java `<enter>`
* git commit `<enter>`
* i (to get into insert mode for commit message)
* edited ListExamples.java
* `<esc>` :wq (exit insert mode, save and enter commit message and confirm commit)
* git push git@github.com:udsingla/lab7.git `<enter>` (push to github)
